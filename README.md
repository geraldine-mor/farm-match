A re-work of a Hackathon project:

During a [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) Christmas Frontend Hackathon, my team and I created a simple matching card game. I was the only team member with JavaScript experience and I had just completed my [Charmed Arcana](https://github.com/geraldine-mor/charmed-arcana) project so the simple card-turning game seemed like a natural choice. We created [Christmas Magic](https://github.com/geraldine-mor/christmas-magic) over the course of the weekend.

During the build, I allowed my 3 year old son to test the game and discovered that I _really_ like watching him enjoy gamed that I have created.

After Christmas the festive theme of Christmas Magic got really old, really fast so my son and I re-designed the game with a farm theme to suit his tastes.
